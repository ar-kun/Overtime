        An overtime management system typically allows employees to request overtime hours through a simple online form, 
        which is then automatically routed to their manager for approval. 
        Once approved, the system tracks the employee’s hours and ensures that they are properly compensated.

       <p>
        To ensure that employees are properly compensated for their overtime hours, the company should have a clear policy in place that outlines how overtime is calculated and paid. 
        This policy should comply with local labor laws and regulations, and should be communicated to all employees. 
        Company may also want to consider using an overtime management system that can automate the process of tracking and calculating overtime hours.
